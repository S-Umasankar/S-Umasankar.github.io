								<p style="text-align:justify;">	Hey, I am Umasankar. I am doing Electronics and Communication Engineering. I was curious to know about the implementation behind the real time systems, which were involving programming and hardware for integration. I was fascinated by those things, and chose this stream. </p>

							<p style="text-align:justify;"> As I was doing my engineering, over the course of my experience, I analysed myself, and discerned that I should concentrate more on programming.  I was fascinated by most of the concepts of C programming and its role with Operating Systems. I studied Python as an online course, and felt that its contribution would be essential to convert my ideas to
							projects. I started following several blogs for machine learning, and was curious to know about that domain. I did a basic online course on neural networks in coursera. When I had an idea, these things really helped me to transform the idea into a project.  Apart from this, I involved myself in various association activities, by being a member of ECE association. This served as a platform for me to engage in social activities and value team spirit. </p>
